# IcedID_Lab_solution


This is a solution guide for the IcedID Lab in CyberDefenders.


Q1 

What is the name of the file associated with the given hash?

Answer

Firstly, you download the file from CyberDefenders and extract the hash value.
After that, you go to the VirusTotal website (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and you search for that specific hash value.
Once you've done that, you go to the "details" tab, scroll down to names, and there you can see the name of the file, which is "document-1982481273.xlsm"

Q2

Can you identify the filename of the GIF file that was deployed?

Answer

To solve this, go to the "Behavior" tab, scroll down until you see "Files dropped," and you will see that the program drops some files to specific locations on the hard drive.
You can see the names of files, and we know that we are looking for a .GIF file. So the file we're looking for is "3003.gif"
